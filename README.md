# FM-HTMLeditor
FM-HTMLEditor - a rich text editor framework for FileMaker


It builds on Tim Dietrich’s [FM EasyHTML](https://timdietrich.me/open-source/]) using techniques described in FileMaker Magazine‘s [Basic JavaScripting – Adding a color picker](https://www.filemakermagazine.com/videos/basic-javascripting-adding-color-picker).

This demo file uses [Summernote](https://summernote.org/), but it could be used with any rich text html editor hosted on a web server or available via a CDN.

If you run this on a computer without a live internet connection, the webviewer (and editor) won’t display.
