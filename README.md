# FM-HTMLeditor
FM-HTMLEditor - a rich text editor framework for FileMaker

![screencapture](/fm-htmleditor-screenshot.png)

It builds on Tim Dietrich’s [FM EasyHTML](https://timdietrich.me/open-source/) using techniques described in FileMaker Magazine‘s [Basic JavaScripting – Adding a color picker](https://www.filemakermagazine.com/videos/basic-javascripting-adding-color-picker).

This demo file uses [Summernote](https://summernote.org/), but it could be used with any rich text html editor hosted on a web server or available via a CDN.

You must [set _furlscript_ to "Full Access"](https://fmhelp.filemaker.com/help/18/fmp/en/index.html#page/FMP_Help/opening-files-url.html) for the script to save editor contents back to FileMaker.

If you run this on a computer without a live internet connection, the webviewer (and editor) won’t display.
